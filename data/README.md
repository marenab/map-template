## Backing Data

This directory contains GeoJSON data files used to produce [tilesets][tileset]
for the Safe Routes to Streets Mapbox project. Each dataset is in the [WGS84
coordinate system][wgs84] required by Mapbox Studio.

- SFMTA routes
  * sfmta_route_li.wgs84.json
- SFMTA route labels
  * sfmta_route_li.wgs84.json
- SFMTA stops
  * sfmta_stop_pt.wgs84.json
- BART stations
  * Provided by Mapbox Streets v8 tileset
- Bikeways
  * TODO
- Bikeshare Stations
  * TODO
- Crossing guards
  * sf_cross_guard_pt.wgs84.json
- School isochrone 5,10,15min
  * sfusd_school_pt_10mins.json, sfusd_school_pt_15mins.json
  * Retrieved with Mapbox Isochrones API using a [script](../scripts/isochrones).
- landuse = park
  * Provided by Mapbox Streets v8 tileset
- Off Street Parking
  * TDOO
- SFUSD School Labels
  * sfusd_school_pt.wgs84.json
- SFUSD School Lands
  * sfusd_school_land_pg.wgs84.json
- School Speed Zones
  * TODO

As part of preparing this data in June 2019, we made some fixes to the
underlying data, which are noted in [this spreadsheet][notes].

## Converting `EPSG:3857` to `EPSG:4326` (WGS84)

The original data provided was in the [`EPSG:3857`][orig_proj] projection. We
reprojected this data into WGS84 using [`reproject`][reproject].

``` bash
$ cat sfusd_school_pt.json \
  | reproject --use-epsg-io --from=EPSG:3857 --to=EPSG:4326 > sfusd_school_pt.wgs84.json
```
